    <!-- Moving the script tags to the bottom also introduces more issues, thus we need to \
    split up or use new tools (ASYNC | DEFER) -->
    <!-- Browser stops rendering when JS is encountered. JS is executed before rendering continues\
    Often referred to counten blocking. Content or Rendered BLocking b/c JS halts the HTML parsing-->
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
    <!-- ASYNC: browser downloads JS in parallel while HTML renders(HTML PARSING). When JS is \
    fully downloaded (JS download) rendering stops while JS is executed(JS EXECUTED). All three\
    steps must take part.-->
    <!-- DEFER: Browser downloads JS (JS download) in parallel while HTML renders, then defers\
    execution of JavaScript until HTML rendering is complete. -->
